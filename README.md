Object detection is a computer vision task that involves identifying and locating objects within an image or video. The goal is to not only classify objects but also predict the precise location of each object in the form of bounding boxes (rectangles) around them. Object detection can detect multiple objects in a single image and assign each object a class label, such as "car," "person," "dog," etc.

Key Components of Object Detection:
Classification: The model assigns a label to an object based on its visual features (e.g., "cat," "dog").
Localization: The model identifies the precise location of the object by drawing a bounding box around it. The coordinates of this box (usually the top-left and bottom-right corners) represent the object's position in the image.
Detection: Combining both classification and localization, the model identifies all objects in the image and provides both their class labels and bounding boxes.
Steps in Object Detection:
Image Input: The model receives an image as input.
Feature Extraction: The model extracts important features from the image using deep learning techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
Bounding Box Prediction: The model predicts the coordinates for each objectâ€™s bounding box and assigns a class label with a confidence score.
Post-Processing: After predictions, techniques like Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) are applied to remove duplicate bounding boxes and keep the most accurate ones.
